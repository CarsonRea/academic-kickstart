I am interested in discovering optimal ways of reducing wealth and social inequality domestically. I am also interested in finding effective methods of relieving the political tension plaguing and dividing the country, using reason, respect, and compassion. I am planning to complete a second Bachelor's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology upon graduating from Emory University.
