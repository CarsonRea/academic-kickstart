I am a third-year math-econ joint major undergraduate student at Emory University pursuing a second bachelorâ€™s degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am Graduating in May 2024. My area of interest is theoretical microeconomics; however, I am also passionate about making education more accessible through technology.
